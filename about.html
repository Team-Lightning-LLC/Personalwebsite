    <h2>Chris Lehman | Founder, Lehman Solutions</h2>
    <b>Trial by Fire</b>
    <p>I’ve always seen in <i>systems</i>—the <i>interconnectedness of all things</i>. Not through charts and wires but in the living patterns of ecosystems, networks, and minds. The emotional logic tied to subtle expression, unique patterns of cognitive flow, the unspoken architecture behind how people move, decide, learn, and struggle. Long before I had the language for it, I was quietly studying the shape of experience, learning how the pieces fit together and how to reduce noise, bring clarity, and simplify without losing meaning when building.</p>

    <p>That way of seeing became the foundation of everything I am. It was extremely challenging to exist in my own mind. I spent many years completely debilitated by my own awareness and ability to dissect and deconstruct systems and self. It's through those many years of existential struggle that my core values were developed. Intentionality, kindness, simplicity, love. I knew the pain of being failed by systems; I understood deeply and personally the flaws of school and healthcare first. My interest in cognition itself arose from many years with debilitating migraines due to Traumatic Brain Injury. Hundereds of doctors appointments, dozens of medications, and no system could fix whatever was going on. There may not always be an external solution, I came to realize, but we can develop environments where the internal solution comes more easily.</p>

    <p>Before tech, I designed learning environments—working as a behavioral technician and tutor, creating spaces that adapted to the minds inside them. I taught gifted and neurodiverse students alike to think critically, develop positive self-reflective tendencies, regulate emotionally, and grow with confidence. My work wasn’t about content delivery—with me it will always be about recognition, acknowledgement, and intuitive grounded response. Systems thinking in its most human form.</p>

    <b>Systems in the Wild</b>
    <p>At Vanguard, I stepped into corporate life—and saw the same core problems. Complexity hidden in processes, A lack of adaptive solutions and real humans weighed down by tools meant to serve them. So I quietly began building between answering the phones:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Automating multi-program workflows</li>
      <li>Designing AI-driven knowledge tools</li>
      <li>Translating frontline experience into architecture that aligned with enterprise direction and communicating that to my team</li>
      <li>Communicating and teaching others about the ways AI can change our lives</li>
      <li>Leading and designing internal projects without the title—just the urgency to help</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The work was never about attention. It was about alignment—between people, purpose, and the systems meant to support them.</p>

    <b>Lehman Solutions</b>
    <p>After Vanguard, I gave that alignment a home. I founded Lehman Solutions to build systems that carry clarity, care, and consciousness. From AI chat architecture and automation pipelines to diagnostic training simulators and financial education tools, I create systems that adapt to the people they serve—emotionally aware, cognitively tuned, and structurally sound.</p>

    <b>What I Bring</b>
 <p><i>Above all things I bring the ability to see through noise and build what matters—solutions that truly impact businesses, teams, and clients. <i></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A lifetime of systems thinking rooted in observation and empathy</li>
      <li>Behavioral science and cognitive learning design</li>
      <li>Corporate strategy experience in high-regulation, high-friction environments</li>
      <li>AI architecture, prompt engineering, and automation design</li>
      <li>Cross-functional translation between users, tech, and leadership</li>
    </ul>

    <p></i>Lehman Solutions exists because I never stopped caring about how people feel inside systems.<br>
    And I never stopped believing they could be better.</p>

    <p><b>Let’s build toward clarity.<br>
    Let’s make it simple.<br>
    Let’s make it work.</b></p>
